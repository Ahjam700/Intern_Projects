# Welcome to Visa For Lisa
This project is about Galaxy Bank, a bank whose management wants to explore converting some of its
deposit customers to become personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). In short,
they want to upsell customers to purchase more banking products from Galaxy Bank.

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
Galaxy Bank struggles with low loan acceptance rates among deposit customers,
leading to inefficient marketing and high costs. The challenge is to identify potential loan acceptors
accurately and improve targeting strategies to optimize conversion rates.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
This project leverages machine learning to predict which customers are likely to accept loan offers.
By analyzing customer data, we optimize marketing campaigns, improve targeting accuracy,
and increase loan conversion rates while reducing acquisition costs.
