## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is classifying musical genres from audio files. The challenge lies in extracting meaningful
features from raw sound data and building an accurate model to automate genre classification.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
We solved the problem by analyzing audio features such as MFCCs, chroma, and tempo. A machine learning
model was trained to classify genres based on these extracted features.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
git install the repo

## Usage
How does it work?
The program loads an audio file, extracts features like MFCCs and tempo, preprocesses the data,
and applies a trained machine learning model to classify the genre. The predicted genre is then displayed.
