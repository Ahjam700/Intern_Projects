# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
-What is the problem?
This project addresses the need for a simple command-line utility to read and output file contents.

-And where is the challenge?
The challenge includes handling multiple files and errors gracefully, similar to the cat command.


## Description
-How have you solved the problem?
I implemented a Python script that reads specified files and prints their contents to standard output.
It also manages errors and supports reading from standard input when no files are provided.

## Installation
-How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install, download or clone the repository to your machine.
There are no dependencies; just ensure you have Python installed to run the script.



## Usage
-How does it work?
The script checks for command-line arguments and reads file contents byte by byte,
writing to standard output. If no files are provided, it reads from standard input,
allowing for versatile usage.
