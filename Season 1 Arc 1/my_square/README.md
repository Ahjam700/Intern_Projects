# Welcome to My Square
In this project we tackle challenges related to grid-based systems. The goal is to simplify square-related
operations with efficiency and ease.

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem revolves around creating a square like figure using characters like "o", "-" and "|".
The challenge lies in ensuring the sides lenghts and the nodes are dependent on each other.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I solve the problem by creating an code that handles conversion of char to int usin atoi function in C. I also take
into consideration that the node should be a "o" and each side a "-" or "|" depending on the axis.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install My Square, run npm install to install dependencies. Alternatively, use make to compile, or make
re for a clean rebuild.

## Usage
How does it work?

The project processes squares, calculating side lengths
and adjustments efficiently using optimized algorithms and data structures for fast performance.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
