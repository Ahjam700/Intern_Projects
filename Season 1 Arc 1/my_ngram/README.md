# Welcome to My Ngram
My Ngram generates and analyzes Ngrams from text data, counting word sequences' frequency.
It's a tool for uncovering patterns and insights in datasets, whether small or large.

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is to generate Ngrams from a given dataset. The challenge lies in efficiently
handling large datasets and correctly counting Ngram frequencies.



## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
The solution involves parsing input text, generating Ngrams, counting their frequencies
and outputting the most common Ngrams found.


## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install, run npm install or use other preferred package managers to install required
dependencies for the project.


## Usage
- How does it work?
The program processes input text, generates Ngrams of specified length, and displays the
most frequent Ngrams and their counts.



```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
