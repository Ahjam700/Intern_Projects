# Welcome to My Mastermind
Welcome to My Mastermind! In this game, you will try to guess a secret code consisting of four digits.
Using clues about well-placed and misplaced digits, you have limited attempts to crack the code.

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem lies in guessing the secret code within a limited number of attempts.
The challenge is deducing the correct code using feedback on well-placed and misplaced
digits while minimizing guesses.

## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
I implemented a feedback system to evaluate guesses, using well-placed and misplaced digit counts,
alongside random code generation for challenges.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Simply compile the C source code with gcc and run the executable.

## Usage
- How does it work?
The Mastermind game generates a secret code, and the player attempts to guess it within a set number of attempts.
Feedback is provided after each guess, indicating well-placed and misplaced digits.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
