# Welcome to My Ds Babel
***

## Task
Our DS babel involves  converting data between two common formats SQL and CSV.
 we create functions that can read data from a database (SQL) and output it in CSV format, and vice versa, convert CSV data back into an SQL database. 
The challenge lies in correctly handling the data transformation, ensuring the integrity of the data across both formats, and managing tables and the contents in it.

## Description
sql_to_csv  in this  function it takes a database file and a table name as input and converts the contents of the table into CSV format. It fetches column names and rows, formats them as CSV, and returns the result as a string.
csv_to_sql in this function takes CSV content, a database file, and a table name as input. It parses the CSV, creates a table if necessary, and inserts the data from the CSV file into the corresponding table in the database.

## Installation
No installation needed in this project just we downloaded the databse file and rthe csv file and we work with them during our projects 

## Usage
converting csv to sql  to insert datas from the csv into the databse and sql to csv it works with  database file name and table name
