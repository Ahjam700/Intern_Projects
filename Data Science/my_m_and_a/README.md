# Welcome to My M And A
Welcome to My M And A, a robust solution for merging and acquiring customer data. It standardizes, cleans,
and integrates diverse datasets into a unified SQL database, ensuring scalability and data quality for exponential growth.

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

The problem is merging inconsistent, incomplete customer data from three CSV files into a standardized database
schema while ensuring data quality, handling missing values, and avoiding intermediate file creation.
The challenge lies in cleaning and transforming diverse input formats to match the target schema, ensuring scalability
, maintaining data integrity, and directly integrating results into an SQL database without saving intermediate CSVs.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
The problem was solved by merging, cleaning, and transforming the CSV data into a standardized format,
ensuring data quality, and directly saving it to an SQL database without creating intermediate files.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

## Usage
How does it work?
It works by reading CSV inputs, merging data, standardizing columns, cleaning values e.g., gender, city handling
missing data, and saving the cleaned DataFrame directly to an SQL database using csv_to_sql.
