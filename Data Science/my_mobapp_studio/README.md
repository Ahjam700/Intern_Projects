2, Break this analysis down by app categories percentages.
3, Understand the ratio of downloads per app in each category.
4, Provide insights to help management decide on app development priorities.
5, Generate plots and visualizations to make the report more understandable for stakeholders.

## Description
Task
To solve this task, I will:
1, Analyze the provided dataset to extract insights on market size, category performance, and pricing.
2, Clean and preprocess the data for accuracy and relevance.
3, Use Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to compute statistics and generate required visualizations.
4, Publish the findings in a structured blog post for management and the VP team to review.
