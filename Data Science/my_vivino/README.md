# Welcome to My Vivino
Welcome to My Vivino, your gateway to an enhanced and personalized wine selection experience. At My Vivino, we aim to provide our users with the most tailored wine recommendations by leveraging the power of data science and machine learning. Our mission is to redefine how people discover and enjoy wines by offering suggestions that match their unique tastes and preferences.

## Task
Problem Statement:The existing wine recommendation system at My Vivino is outdated, relying on rules-based mechanisms. As a result, it struggles to deliver personalized recommendations and lags behind competitors like my_wine.com, which have embraced advanced data science techniques.
Challenge:Develop a machine-learning-powered wine recommendation system that provides more accurate, personalized suggestions based on customer preferences, ratings, and other data insights. This project aims to improve user experience, increase customer satisfaction, and drive sales.
## Description
We are building a personalized wine recommendation system using machine learning. This system will analyze customer data, including past purchases, ratings, reviews, and browsing history, to predict and recommend wines that align with individual preferences.
Steps Taken to Solve the Problem:
1, Hypotheses and Assumptions:
Customers are more likely to purchase wines that match their taste preferences based on past ratings and reviews.
Advanced machine learning models e.g., collaborative filtering or deep learning, can outperform rules-based systems in predicting preferences.
2, Data Collection:
Scraped data from online wine marketplaces e.g., Vivino, Wine-Searcher, to gather information on wines, ratings, reviews, prices, and attributes (e.g., region, grape type, food pairing).
Collected user behavioral data e.g., purchase history, browsing activity.
3, Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Removed duplicates and inconsistencies in wine names, reviews, and ratings.
Standardized attributes such as grape type, region, and food pairings.
Handled missing values by applying imputation techniques.
4, Exploratory Data Analysis EDA:
Visualized trends such as the most popular wines, frequently reviewed attributes, and regional preferences.
Identified correlations between user ratings and wine characteristics e.g., grape type, price.
5, Model Development:
Implemented collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation models.
Used natural language processing NLP to extract insights from user reviews and detect valuable comments.
Compared model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error MSE and precision/recall.
6, Results and Business Impact:
Showcased model accuracy and improvement over the existing rules-based system.
Demonstrated potential to boost customer satisfaction and revenue.
Next Steps:
Expand the recommendation system to include wine pairings for meal recipes.
Introduce real-time recommendations on the app and website.
Explore cross-market opportunities e.g., whisky, beer.
