# Welcome to My Roman Numerals Converter
***

## Task
-What is the problem? 
The problem is converting numbers between Roman numerals and their modern integer equivalents.

And where is the challenge?
The challenge lies in handling the irregularity of the Roman numeral system, where certain combinations
like IV or IX represent subtractions not just additions, making it non-trivial to parse and convert accurately.

## Description
-How have you solved the problem?
I implemented an algorithm that correctly interprets Roman numeral patterns by handling each numeral,
including subtraction cases. The solution parses from left to right, comparing symbols and applying the
correct rules for Roman numeral conversions. It ensures accurate and reliable transformations for both
integer-to-Roman and Roman-to-integer conversions

## Installation
-How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install the project, simply clone the repository and run the following command to install the
necessary dependencies:

## Usage
-How does it work?
The converter takes an integer or Roman numeral as input. For integer-to-Roman conversion,
it breaks down the integer into Roman numeral parts. For Roman-to-integer conversion,
it scans the numeral and calculates the value by adding or subtracting based on Roman numeral rules.
The user can input either format, and the program will return the appropriate conversion.
