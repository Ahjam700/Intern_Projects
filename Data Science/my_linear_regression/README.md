# Welcome to My Linear Regression

This project implements linear regression techniques to predict target values from feature data. 
It demonstrates both Least Squares Regression for direct parameter calculation and Gradient Descent
for iterative optimization.

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is predicting a target variable using linear regression. The challenge lies in selecting the
optimal model parameters weights to minimize the error, and choosing between direct calculation and
iterative optimization.

## Description
-How have you solved the problem?
The problem is solved by implementing Least Squares Regression for direct parameter calculation and
Gradient Descent for iterative optimization, minimizing the Mean Squared Error MSE  to make accurate
predictions.

## Installation

-How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Since this project is implemented in Python as inferred from the use of numpy and matplotlib,
the installation process doesn't involve npm or make. Instead, you install dependencies using pip.


## Usage
-How does it work?
Generate data, add bias term, and apply either Least Squares Regression or Gradient Descent to fit the model.
Visualize predictions and adjust hyperparameters for better performance.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
