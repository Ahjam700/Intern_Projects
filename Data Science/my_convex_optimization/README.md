# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
This project demonstrates convex optimization methods, including root-finding algorithms,
gradient descent, and linear programming, offering practical solutions to optimization problems
using Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy.


## Task
-What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is optimizing mathematical functions efficiently, particularly convex optimization tasks.
The challenge lies in finding function minima, solving constraints, and implementing algorithms like
gradient descent and linear programming.


## Description
-How have you solved the problem?
We solved the problem by implementing numerical methods such as bisection, Newton-Raphson, gradient descent,
and the Simplex method. Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib were utilized for computations.
