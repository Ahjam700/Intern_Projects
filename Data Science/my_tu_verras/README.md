# Welcome to My Tu Verras
My Tu Verras is a project designed to predict house prices in Boston using data-driven insights.
The primary objective is to understand the factors influencing house prices and develop an accurate
prediction model leveraging machine learning techniques. This project serves as a practical application
of data analysis, visualization, and linear regression modeling in Python.

## Task
The problem is to predict house prices based on predefined criteria using the Boston housing dataset.
The challenge lies in understanding the data, cleaning it, exploring relationships between features,
and building an accurate linear regression prediction model.

## Description
The problem was solved by dividing the task into several steps:
-Loading and understanding the dataset to familiarize ourselves with its structure and attributes.
-Cleaning the dataset by removing rows with missing values to ensure accuracy.
-Visualizing the data through histograms and scatter plots to identify patterns and correlations.
-Computing the Pearson correlation coefficients to analyze relationships between features and the target variable MEDV.
-Building a linear regression model using the most influential features to predict house prices.
-Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error MAE, Mean Squared Error MSE,
and Root Mean Squared Error RMSE.

## Installation
