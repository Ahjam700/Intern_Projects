# Welcome to My Select Query
My Select Query is a Python class that simulates a basic SQL-style query on CSV data.
It allows filtering based on column values, providing an easy way to query CSVs.


## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem lies in querying structured data CSV efficiently. The challenge is building
a flexible query mechanism, similar to SQL, that works on basic string-based CSV input.


## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
The problem is solved by creating a MySelectQuery class that parses CSV data into rows and columns.
The where method filters rows based on specified criteria.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install, simply clone the repository and install Python dependencies if any. No special
installation is needed beyond having Python installed on your system.

## Usage
- How does it work?
After instantiating the MySelectQuery class with CSV data, use the where method to
filter rows based on column values. It returns matching rows as strings in a list.


```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
