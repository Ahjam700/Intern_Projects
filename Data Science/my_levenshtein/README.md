# Welcome to My Levenshtein
Calculating the min number of edits to convert one string to another.

The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is simple: it's a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them. (For information, the Levenshtein 
number is a real concept but we've simplified it a bit for the purposes of this exercise.)

## Task
What is the problem?
Calculating the min number of edits to convert one string to another.

And where is the challenge?
Handling large strings efficiently and minimizing computation time for edit distance


## Description
-How have you solved the problem?
I applied dynamic programming to implement Levenshtein algorithm for optimal performance

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Clone this repository.
Run: npm install or use make and make re for builds.

## Usage
How does it work?
-Input two strings.
-The program calculates and returns the minimum number of edits like insertions, deletions and substitutions
